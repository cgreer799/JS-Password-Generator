# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This assignment was to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

When the user clicks the button to generate a password, they will receive a series of prompts asking for the desired password length and the types of characters to use. It will then give the user a generated password that meets the criteria given to it.
